- **Gardenize:** Good plant diary, lacks spatial planning
- **GrowVeg:** Good planning, limited plant database
- **PlantNet:** Great plant ID, no garden management
- **iScape:** Professional focused, expensive

#### Technical Decisions Made
- PostgreSQL 17 over MySQL (PostGIS support)
- GraphQL over REST-only (complex queries)
- Firebase over Auth0 (better integration)
- Go over Node.js (performance)
- Flutter over React Native (web-first)
