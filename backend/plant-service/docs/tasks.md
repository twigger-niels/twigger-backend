## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- Using Cloud SQL PostgreSQL with PostGIS for all spatial operations
- GraphQL for complex queries, REST for simple
- Firebase for authentication
- 7-part independent architecture
- Mock services for testing

### Open Questions
- [ ] How detailed should shade calculations be?
- [ ] What's the maximum garden size to support?
- [ ] How many climate zones to support initially?
- [ ] Should we cache analysis results?
- [ ] What's the data retention policy?

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: PostGIS query performance
  - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, query optimization
- **Risk**: Complex spatial calculations slow
  - **Mitigation**: Pre-calculate and cache results
- **Risk**: Integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Mock services, independent testing

## 📊 Migration Fixes Completed (2025-10-03)

During Part 5 implementation, several migration issues were discovered and fixed:

### Migration Tool Enhancement
- ✅ Added `force [version]` command to `cmd/migrate/main.go`
- ✅ Added `ForceMigrationVersion()` function to `internal/db/migrate.go`
- **Purpose**: Fix dirty migration state without manual database intervention

### Migration 006 Schema Fix
**Issue**: Attempted to create index on non-existent `plant_species.full_botanical_name` column
**Fix**: Removed the invalid index creation line
```diff
- CREATE INDEX idx_plant_species_botanical_name_trgm
- ON plant_species USING GIN (full_botanical_name gin_trgm_ops);
```
**File**: `migrations/006_add_gin_trigram_indexes.up.sql`

### Migration 007 GIST Index Fix
**Issue**: Attempted to create GIST composite indexes mixing UUID and geometry types (not supported)
**Fix**: Replaced composite GIST indexes with separate non-spatial and spatial indexes
```diff
- CREATE INDEX idx_gardens_user_boundary ON gardens USING GIST(user_id, boundary);
+ CREATE INDEX idx_gardens_user_id ON gardens(user_id);
+ CREATE INDEX idx_gardens_boundary ON gardens USING GIST(boundary);
```
**File**: `migrations/007_add_spatial_indexes.up.sql`

### Migration 002 Created
**Purpose**: Minimal localization tables subset (only tables with existing dependencies)
- Created `000002_add_localization_minimal.up.sql`
- Includes: `plant_common_names`, `plant_descriptions`, `characteristic_translations`, `companion_benefits_i18n`, `country_names_i18n`
- Excludes: Tables that reference non-existent `plant_problems` table (from future Part 4)
**Files**:
- `migrations/000002_add_localization_minimal.up.sql`
- `migrations/000002_add_localization_minimal.down.sql`

### Diagnostic Tools Created
- `cmd/check-db/main.go` - Check migration status and table existence
- `cmd/check-columns/main.go` - Verify table column names and types
- `cmd/check-gardens/main.go` - Inspect garden-related table schemas
- `cmd/check-data-sources/main.go` - Check data_sources table schema
- `cmd/check-seed-data/main.go` - Verify seeded data counts
- `cmd/apply-migration-005/main.go` - Attempt manual migration 005 (deprecated)

### Test Data Seeding
**Created**: `cmd/seed-simple/main.go` - Minimal test data seeder
**Seeded Data**:
- ✅ 4 Languages: English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de)
- ✅ 5 Countries: US, MX, FR, DE, GB
- ✅ 1 Test Plant: Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato)
  - Plant hierarchy: Solanaceae family → Solanum genus → lycopersicum species
  - Localized names in 4 languages (Tomato/Tomate)
- ✅ 1 Data Source: Test Seed Data (reliability: 5/5)

**Note**: Initial complex seeder (`cmd/seed-test-data/main.go`) encountered foreign key issues due to existing data conflicts. Simplified version created to handle idempotent seeding.

### Service Layer Quick Fix
**File**: `backend/plant-service/domain/service/plant_service.go`
**Change**: Replaced hardcoded `"en"` ISO code with actual English UUID `"8a86d436-e58f-4e2c-aac1-2e3c5a7b10cf"`
**Locations**: 5 fixes (FindByID, GetPhysicalCharacteristics, GetGrowingConditions, Search, FindByBotanicalName)
**Status**: ⚠️ **TEMPORARY HACK** - Proper fix requires Part 6 to extract language from request context
**Impact**: API now works with test data, but uses hardcoded English instead of user's preferred language
