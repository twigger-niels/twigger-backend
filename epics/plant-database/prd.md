# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Plant Database & Garden Management System

### Executive Summary
A comprehensive plant database system with spatial garden mapping capabilities, designed to help gardeners plan, manage, and optimize their gardens using scientific plant data and spatial analysis.

- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for localization queries
- **Language-Aware Caching**: Separate cache entries per language/country with pattern invalidation
- **Repository Validation**: Input validation at repository boundary (UUIDs + ISO codes)
- **Service Layer Defaults**: Temporary English hardcoding with TODO markers for API integration
