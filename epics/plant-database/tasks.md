## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- Using Cloud SQL PostgreSQL with PostGIS for all spatial operations
- GraphQL for complex queries, REST for simple
- Firebase for authentication
- 7-part independent architecture
- Mock services for testing

### Open Questions
- [ ] How detailed should shade calculations be?
- [ ] What's the maximum garden size to support?
- [ ] How many climate zones to support initially?
- [ ] Should we cache analysis results?
- [ ] What's the data retention policy?

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: PostGIS query performance
  - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, query optimization
- **Risk**: Complex spatial calculations slow
  - **Mitigation**: Pre-calculate and cache results
- **Risk**: Integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Mock services, independent testing
