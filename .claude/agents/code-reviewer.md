# Code Review Agent

## Overview

A code review agent for Go/PostgreSQL/GraphQL systems that automatically analyzes code changes and provides comprehensive feedback on quality, security, performance, and adherence to best practices.

## Purpose

Automate code quality checks and provide consistent, objective feedback on pull requests to maintain high code standards across the development team.

## Technology Stack Coverage

### Go
- Language version: Go 1.21+
- Frameworks: Standard library, popular frameworks (Gin, Echo, Fiber)
- Testing: Go test, testify, gomock

### PostgreSQL
- Versions: PostgreSQL 14+
- Migration tools: golang-migrate, goose
- Query builders: sqlx, pgx, GORM

### GraphQL
- Implementations: gqlgen, graphql-go
- Schema standards: GraphQL spec compliant
- Federation support (if applicable)

## Core Review Capabilities

### 1. Go Code Analysis

#### Static Analysis
- **Idiomatic Go Patterns**
  - Error handling patterns (wrap errors with context)
  - Interface design and usage
  - Proper use of goroutines and channels
  - Context propagation patterns

#### Security Checks
- SQL injection prevention in database queries
- Proper sanitization of user inputs
- Secure random number generation
- Credential and secret management
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

#### Performance Analysis
- Memory leak detection
- Goroutine leak identification
- Inefficient loops and algorithms
- Unnecessary allocations
- Proper use of sync.Pool

#### Code Quality
- Cyclomatic complexity thresholds
- Function length limits
- Package cohesion
- Test coverage requirements (minimum 80%)
- Documentation coverage

### 2. PostgreSQL Review

#### Query Analysis
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Missing index detection
  - N+1 query identification
  - Inefficient JOIN operations
  - Full table scan warnings
  - Query execution plan analysis

#### Schema Review
- Migration script validation
- Backward compatibility checks
- Index strategy review
- Constraint validation
- Data type appropriateness

#### Best Practices
- Transaction scope analysis
- Connection pool configuration
- Prepared statement usage
- Deadlock prevention patterns
- Proper NULL handling

### 3. GraphQL Review

#### Schema Design
- **Type System**
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Proper use of interfaces and unions
  - Input type validation
  - Deprecation handling
  - Schema versioning strategy

#### Resolver Analysis
- Data fetching efficiency
- N+1 query prevention (DataLoader pattern)
- Resolver complexity limits
- Error handling consistency
- Field-level authorization

#### Security
- Query depth limiting
- Query complexity analysis
- Rate limiting implementation
- Authentication/Authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization

## Automated Checks

### Pre-Commit Hooks
```yaml
- gofmt/goimports formatting
- golangci-lint static analysis
- GraphQL schema validation
- SQL syntax checking
- Unit test execution
```

### Pull Request Checks
```yaml
- Full test suite execution
- Integration test validation
- Benchmark comparisons
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audit
- Code coverage reporting
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```yaml
- Performance regression detection
- API breaking change detection
- Database migration conflicts
- GraphQL schema compatibility
- Documentation updates
```

## Review Rules Configuration

### Severity Levels

| Level        | Description                                   | Action Required |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks     | Block merge     |
| **HIGH**     | Performance issues, bugs, breaking changes    | Review required |
| **MEDIUM**   | Code quality issues, best practice violations | Should fix      |
| **LOW**      | Style issues, minor improvements              | Nice to have    |
| **INFO**     | Suggestions, alternative approaches           | Optional        |
