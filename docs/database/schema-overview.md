### 4. **User Gardens Layer**
Spatial garden management and plant tracking:

| Table | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `users` | User accounts | Location detection, hardiness zones |
| `gardens` | User garden definitions | Spatial boundaries, environmental data |
| `garden_zones` | Garden subdivisions | Beds, borders, microclimates |
| `garden_features` | Physical features | Trees, buildings for shade analysis |
| `garden_plants` | Plant placements | Spatial locations, health tracking |

## Data Types and Standards

### Measurement Domains
Standardized measurement types with validation:

- **Temperature**: `temperature_c` (-273.1 to 100.0Â°C)
- **Length**: `length_m`, `length_cm`, `length_mm` (non-negative)
- **Area**: `area_m2` (non-negative square meters)
- **Weight**: `weight_g`, `weight_kg` (non-negative)
- **Time**: `days`, `hours`, `years` (non-negative integers)
- **Quality**: `percentage` (0-100%), `ph_value` (0-14), `rating` (1-5 stars)

### Enum Types
Controlled vocabularies for consistency:

- **`plant_type`**: tree, shrub, perennial, annual, biennial, bulb, grass, fern, climber, aquatic, succulent, palm, bamboo, orchid, vine
- **`confidence_level`**: very_low, low, moderate, probable, very_high, confirmed
- **`sun_requirement`**: full_sun, partial_sun, partial_shade, full_shade, morning_sun, afternoon_shade, dappled_shade
- **`water_needs`**: very_dry, dry, moderate, moist, wet, aquatic, bog
- **`soil_drainage`**: very_well_drained, well_drained, moderate_drainage, poorly_drained, waterlogged
- **`growth_rate`**: very_slow, slow, moderate, fast, very_fast

### Composite Types
Complex data structures for related measurements:

- **`temp_range`**: min, max, optimal temperatures
- **`ph_range`**: min, max, optimal pH values
- **`size_range`**: min, typical, max sizes

## Spatial Capabilities

### PostGIS Integration
Full spatial analysis support with:

- **GEOMETRY**: Planar coordinates for local calculations
- **GEOGRAPHY**: Spherical coordinates for global accuracy
- **SRID 4326**: WGS84 global coordinate system
- **Spatial Indexes**: GIST indexes for optimal performance

### Spatial Features
- Country and climate zone boundaries
- Garden mapping with zones and features
- Plant placement tracking
- Shade analysis from garden features
- Distance and area calculations
- Optimal planting location algorithms

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexing Strategy
Comprehensive indexing for optimal performance:

1. **Foreign Key Indexes**: All foreign key relationships
2. **Spatial Indexes**: GIST indexes on all geometry/geography columns
3. **Text Search Indexes**: GIN indexes for full-text search
4. **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for common queries

### Query Optimization
- Generated columns for calculated fields
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Spatial function optimization
- Connection pooling configuration

## Data Quality and Confidence

### Source Tracking
Every piece of growing condition and physical characteristic data is linked to:
- **Data Source**: Reliability-scored source
- **Confidence Level**: Six-level confidence scale
- **Verification Date**: Last verification timestamp

### Multi-Source Consensus
- Multiple sources can provide data for the same plant
- Confidence levels help prioritize conflicting information
- Source reliability scores weight the data quality

## Extensibility Features

### JSONB Flexibility
Physical characteristics include a flexible `traits` JSONB column for:
- Leaf shapes and colors
- Flower characteristics
- Bark textures
- Root depth information
- Custom properties

### Array Support
Multiple value support for:
- Common names (text arrays)
- Climate systems (text arrays)
- Sun requirements (enum arrays)
- Soil types (text arrays)
- Flowering/fruiting months (integer arrays)
